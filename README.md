# Linear-Regression-prediction
This data set is about number of hours of studying and marks scored.
In order to understand the relationship trend between two columns,a simple visualization is made.
From the graph it is certain that as hours increases score also increases and logically it is correct.
So a linear regression model is used to fit the train_data and then predict the test_data set.
Accuracy evaluation metric is used to determine the accuracy of the model is 95.58%
